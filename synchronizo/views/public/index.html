            <p>Listening to music is fun, but listening to music with other people is even more fun.</p>
            <p>Synchronizo aims to allow you to easily listen to music simultaneously with people
               when they aren't a stone's throw away. You make a music room, add some music and invite
               some people. It's that simple.
